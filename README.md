XADMaster - Modified Library for iComics
************************************************

This is the copy of the XADMaster framework that was implemented
into iComics v1.1 onwards.

It has been stripped down to the bare elements required to function,
and certain methods have been modified to align with the iComics codebase 
properly.

Per the LGPL agreement, it is publically avaialble here, for free.
